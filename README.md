  ## Kinyozi acts as the front-end web interface to display a django made API, for all the portfolio images and styles and stylists. The API allows for a database that can continue to grow, it is also one of the few ways that an angular frontend can interact with a django backend.

  ## Set up includes the calling of the API so as to allow it to display on angular. You need to include services for this task. It could be much clearer to have a separate service for each API.

  ## No known bugs except for making a POST request using the API.

  ## Technologies Used were Angular 6, MD Bootstrap, Django.
